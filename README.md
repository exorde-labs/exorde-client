# Introduction to the Exorde ecosystem
The world is a vast, interconnected network of ideas, opinions, and information, constantly buzzing with activity. It can be tough to keep up with all the chatter, especially when language barriers and political biases get in the way. But what if there was a way to tap into this global conversation, in real-time, without any filters or restrictions? Enter Exorde Network, a cutting-edge platform that leverages the power of decentralized networks and AI to bring you the latest news, trends, and viral data events worldwide.

# The Exorde client

The exorde client is a foundational base for decentralized, modulable, robust scraping & Machine-learning-powered real-time streaming analytics.

The Exorde Network is a decentralized network of workers collecting newly posted information on multiple sources online, translating them live, extracting valuable metadata & submitting their data by batches to the Exorde Protocol. The goal of the Exorde Network is to form an incentivized, automated-rewards & secure platform where Exorde workers (nodes running the exorde-client) can compete to collect the best data, the fastest, and get automatically rewarded. It makes sense to either participate in our open-source bounties program, build additional scrapers, or fork the scrapers and upgrade them yourself, to be competitive. Adapting strategies to match

# The Exorde open source data ecosystem

The Exorde philosophy: plug your workers, interact with the protocol, submit valuable (and untampered) data, and get rewarded with EXD tokens. The first workers on the newest and most relevant information earn more!
